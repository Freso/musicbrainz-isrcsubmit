<h2>Available Downloads</h2>

<div class="twolineheadings">

<h3>isrcsubmit.py:</h3>
<h4>(core script)</h4>

This is the core script and mainly intended for Linux users.
The additional libraries can be installed with the package manager of your distribution or manually.


<h3>isrcsubmit-\*-MacIntel/PPC:</h3>
<h4>(script + libdiscid + python-musicbrainz2)</h4>

These are packages for Mac OS X users.
It is more difficult to get libdiscid precompiled for Mac and less Mac users have Xcode installed to compile it themselves (or don't have root privileges)
Therefore the Mac Packages include a precompiled libdiscid.0.dylib for the appropriate architecture.
The Intel32 and PPC libraries are taken from MusicBrainz Picard.
I compiled the 64-bit version.


<h3>isrcsubmit-\*.tar.gz:</h3>
<h4>(official tarball; complete source download as on github)</h4>

This is the official release version.
This is basically the same as downloading the tag in github. There might be minor packaging differences and the folder name is different.
